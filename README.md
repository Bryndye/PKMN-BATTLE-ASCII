# Pokémon ASCII

A minimalist Pokémon-inspired game built entirely in **pure PHP**, created as a learning project. This game merges elements of Pokémon and Rogue-Lite genres, focusing solely on battles and team management.

## 🌟 Features
- **Choose your Starter Pokémon** and embark on a journey through **100 floors** of challenges (and more).
- Battle wild Pokémon, trainers, arena champions, and even take on the Pokémon League.
- **Capture Legendary Pokémon** and complete your Pokédex (if you're lucky enough to encounter them!).
- Simple ASCII visuals for a retro gaming experience.

## 🎮 Gameplay
This is a simplified version of Pokémon:
- No world exploration — just battles and management screens.
- Strategize your team and inventory between battles.
- Challenge yourself to reach the top floor and conquer all obstacles.
